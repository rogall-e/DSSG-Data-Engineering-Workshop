# How organisations store data

I would claim that all organisations store data in some kind of database. Most start with something like Excel or Google Sheets and most also never stop to use Spreadsheet. What changes over the years might be the amount of data and the growing urge to have more control over it. **Following this urge of handling the chaos might be called Data Engineering.**

## The Evolution of a Data Org
I am sketching a totally arthificial and simplified evolution of a data organisation. The goal is to show the different phases of data engineering and the different challenges that come with it. The phases are not strictly separated and most likely there are many more phases and variations of the ones I am describing. The phases are also not necessarily linear and can be repeated.

<!-- TODO:: Try to find names for the differeny phases  -->


### Small (Non Tech) Organisations (1-50 people)
Assuming the core business of an organisation is not data! Then most potentially at the start of an organization the focus is not on data related things. From the beginning there was data gathering happening but most potentially in a mostly non-systematic way that was highly dependend on the invividuals. Some functions might have been using Excel or Google Sheets to store data and report it to the management or other functions. The data gathering was most likely motivated from a operations perspective.

### Medium (Non Tech) Organisations (50-500 people)

### Big/Corporate (Non Tech) Organisations (500+ people)
