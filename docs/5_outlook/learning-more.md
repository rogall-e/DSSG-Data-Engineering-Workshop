# Where to go from here.

We know that half a day is a short time to get started with a potentially completely new topic. And we don't want to leave you alone with all the new things you learned today. So here are some pointers on where to go from here:

Depending on where you want to deepen your knowledge and what type of learner you are, we have a few recommendations for you:

## Learning more on specific tools and concepts

### Databases

### DBT
If you are more of a reader, we recommend you to take a look at the [docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/). They are very well written and provide a lot of information on how to use dbt.

### Extract and Load
- [Airbyte](https://airbyte.io/) provides great guides on how to use their tool. You can find them [here](https://docs.airbyte.io/). Furthermore Airbyte follows a community approach for developing connectors. Developing a connector to e.g. a new API is very easy and you can find a guide [here](https://docs.airbyte.io/tutorials/building-a-connector). 
It will teach you a lot about the way data is shared and extracted from SaaS tools nowadays and how a lot of orgs are filling their data warehouses.

## Bootcamps and Courses
If you want a bigger curriculum, we recommend you to take a look at the following courses:
- [DataTalks.Club Data Engineering Bootcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp)
- In Person Bootcamp (e.g. Neue Fische Bootcamp)

## Exercices
We hope that you liked the Pokemon example we covered today. As you can imagine there are lots of things that we had no time to cover. So here are a few ideas for extending our data platform:

- Add a new source to Airbyte by direcly calling the Pokemon API. You can find the documentation [here](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). To have a quick walkthrough of how to add a new source to Airbyte, you can take a look at the [docs](https://docs.airbyte.io/tutorials/building-a-connector).
- Add more transformations in dbt. You might want to try out the new semantic layer that was introduced in the recent version of dbt.

- There are cool new tools for data visualization.
